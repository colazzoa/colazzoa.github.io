👋 Hi, I’m Alessandro Colazzo

👀 I’m interested in signal processing for telecommunications (5G NR, LTE, NB-IoT) and IoT

🌱 I’m currently learning Data Oriented Programming (just started) and machine learning

🤓 Things I would like to learn soon: vector programming on x86 and GPU (SIMD) and deep learning applied on 5G receivers, such as the framework [Sionna](https://developer.nvidia.com/sionna)!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning applied to physical layer processing of wireless protocols

📜 Have a look on my [Publications](https://colazzoa.github.io/publications) !
